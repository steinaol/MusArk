# Docker

Docker is a very central piece of technology for the MUSIT system. It's **highly** recommended that all members of the team are familiar with docker and the docker eco-system. The team should ensure that there is _at least_ one team member knows enough to perform intermediate/advanced operations/configurations.

Without a proper understanding of how docker works, it is nearly impossible to ensure that the software running in docker containers function properly.

Hopefully the below links and references will guide you towards a better understanding of Docker. What it is, what it does and how to use it properly
