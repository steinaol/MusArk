# Scala and related frameworks & libraries

The entire [MUSIT backend](https://gitlab.com/MUSIT-Norway/musit) project is
written in Scala. It should therefore _very_ important that the team has a
goal of constantly learning and improving their know-how about Scala.

Learning Scala involves a bit more than just learning Scala "the language".
Since it's built to run on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), it is **key** to
understand what running on the JVM implies. The importance of understandig
how Java "the language" affects Scala cannot be stressed enough.

The primary goal should, however, be to learn Scala "the language". When moving
beyond the beginner level and into the intermediate level it is time to look in
more detail at the JVM.

Our backend technology stack is built up using a few very well known libraries
and frameworks. It is **very** important to learn how these work.

Below is a curated list of learning and reference materials that might prove
usefull in your journey towrads Scala mastery:

#### Documentation

* [Scala documentation](http://docs.scala-lang.org)
* [SBT - Scala Build Tool](http://www.scala-sbt.org/documentation.html).
* [Play! Framework](https://playframework.com/documentation/2.6.x/ScalaHome) for Scala developers.
* [Slick](http://slick.lightbend.com/docs/)
* [Akka](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/index.html) including (akka-streams, akka-http, etc...)

#### Learning

* [Play Starter Projects](https://playframework.com/download): A good place to get started with the Play! Framework. Offering both starter and sample projects to play around with.
* [Scala puzzlers](http://scalapuzzlers.com): A fun way to learn about Scala.
* [Scala exercises](https://www.scala-exercises.org): A good way to learn about different Scala technologies. Including the stdlib.
* [Functional Programming in Scala #1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1): First in a series of courses with increasing difficulty. Quite focused on mathematical / theoretical problems, and not so much on the practical day to day (usefull) aspects.
* [Functional Program Design in Scala #2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun2): Same as above only harder.

#### Videos, talks and presentations
