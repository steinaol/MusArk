# Nginx

In front of the backend services in the MUSIT system, there is a docker
container running an instance of Nginx. It's acts as an API gateway into the
correct service application / endpoints. This is achieved by configuring nginx
as a reverse proxy.

It's usefull to be familiar with Nginx and how to configure it.
