# MUSIT Admin client

There is an administration client available for the MUSIT system. Currently it provides access to functionality for managing users and access rights to museums and collections. It is, however, easily extendable to deal with other administrative tasks.

## Architecture

TBD

* service_auth
* database => MUSARK_AUTH
* 100% Playframework
* Twirl templates (play's server side rendering framework)
    * Client is created by "backend-team" and exposed as separate web-application
    * regular HTML + CSS (~no javascript involved)
* security
